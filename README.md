# Dudex Smart Academy - Teacher Portal

A faculty management web application for Dudex Smart Academy, powered by **React 19**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, Row Level Security, Storage, Realtime, and Database Functions).

---

## Architecture

The Teacher Portal is integrated with a centralized Supabase backend designed to be shared across:
1. **Teacher Portal** (Faculty management, attendance, live placement classes, notes, question bank, assessments, results)
2. **Student Portal** (Student dashboard, live class join, notes viewing, assessment taking, results)
3. **Admin Portal** (Institutional administration, user provisioning, audit inspection)
